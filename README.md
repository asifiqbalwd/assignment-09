- **Mobile**: The layout compresses, reducing font size and padding, ensuring it looks just as good on small screens.

## 🎨 Aesthetic Touches

- **Background Color**: Soft, light teal `#e0f7fa` sets a calm tone for the page.
- **Header**: Dark teal `#00796b` in the table header makes the section titles pop.
- **Hover Effects**: Rows change color to a brighter shade of teal on hover, adding interactivity.
